# About
Waiters are required to tip out at the end of the shift. This means that servers give a percentage of their tips to other employees. Imagine serving for a five-hour shift and not receiving any tips.
Don't know how to tip. No problem, TIPEX is all about making tipping easy and accurate. Some people follow the standard 15 â€“ 20 percent tip, but others tip based on performance. TIPEX calculates tips based on your review and reviews of the restaurant on Zomato.

<h6>FUN FACT: DONâ€™T LEAVE YOUR SERVER YOUR NUMBER WITHOUT TIPPING. THATâ€™S JUST EMBARRASSING!ðŸ˜†
